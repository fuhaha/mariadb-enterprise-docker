* Documentation at https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise/mariadb-enterprise-in-docker/

* To build this image, you must set your MariaDB Enterprise Download Token in the file **mdbe-token**. You can get a Download Token for free by registering at MariaDB My Portal: https://mariadb.com/my_portal/
* For now, you must also manually set the server version to use for the build. Write the full version (e.g. 10.0.21) in the **mdbe-version** file.
